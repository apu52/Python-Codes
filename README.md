<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
 1. Write a python program to display a message on the screen as follows.
We are the students from the dept. of Information Technology.
We are learning Python.
It is our odd semester.

2. Write a python program to convert a temperature in Celsius scale to its equivalent Fahrenheit scale.
3. Write a python program to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle, a square and a rectangle. Consider all the required information is preexistent.
4. Write a python program to find out the greatest among three integers.
5. Write a program to swap the value of two variables using a third variable and without using a third variable.
6. Write a program to rotate the value of x, y, and z such that x has the value of y, y has the value of z and z has the value of x.
7. Write a program to display the following numbers: 5678, 678, 78, 8, where the given number is 5678.
8. Write a program to add two complex numbers by reading the numbers from the user.
9. Write a program to accept the principal amount, rate of interest, and duration from the user. Calculate the interest amount and the total amount (principal + interest).
10. Write a program to calculate simple interest with the following conditions:
If the principal amount is less than 2,00,000 the interest rate is 10%.
If the principal amount is 2,00,000 -10,00,000 the interest rate is 12%.
If the principal amount is greater than 10,00,000 the interest rate is 15%
11. Write a python program to find out the roots of a quadratic equation and also find the type of the roots.
    
<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

12) Write a python program to find out the Fibonacci series. The series length, N will be as per
user’s choice.
i.e., if N=10, then the series is
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

14) Ask for a number N from the user. Now determine whether N is a member of the Fibonacci
series.
15) Enter a digit N and further find out the sum of (N + NN + NNN),
i.e., if N = 5, then sum = (5+55+555) = 615.
16) Print the following pattern for n number of lines, i.e. if n=5, then it will look as below.
(a)
 1
 2*2
 3***3
 4*****4
5*******5
(b) 1
2 , 3
4, 5, 6
7 , 8, 9, 10
11, 12, 13, 14, 15
17) Print all the factors of any given number.
18) Find the factorial of a number entered by the user.
19) Write a program using a while loop to print all the odd numbers within a given range.
20) Write a program to compute the GCD and LCM of two integer numbers.
21) Find the prime numbers for a range that will be mentioned by the User.
22) Find the solution for the series given as (1/1! + 1/2! +1/3! + ….. + 1/N!).
The value of N will be mentioned by the User.
23) Check for any given number is Armstrong or not.
Note an Armstrong number is such a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
24) Write a program to check whether a given number is a prime number or not.
25) Write a program to find the sum of all prime numbers within a given range.
26) Write a program that prompts users to enter numbers. This process repeats until the
user enters -1. Finally, the program prints the count of prime and composite numbers
entered.
