<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

12) Write a python program to find out the Fibonacci series. The series length, N will be as per
user’s choice.
i.e., if N=10, then the series is
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

14) Ask for a number N from the user. Now determine whether N is a member of the Fibonacci
series.
15) Enter a digit N and further find out the sum of (N + NN + NNN),
i.e., if N = 5, then sum = (5+55+555) = 615.
16) Print the following pattern for n number of lines, i.e. if n=5, then it will look as below.
(a)
 1
 2*2
 3***3
 4*****4
5*******5
(b) 1
2 , 3
4, 5, 6
7 , 8, 9, 10
11, 12, 13, 14, 15
17) Print all the factors of any given number.
18) Find the factorial of a number entered by the user.
19) Write a program using a while loop to print all the odd numbers within a given range.
20) Write a program to compute the GCD and LCM of two integer numbers.
21) Find the prime numbers for a range that will be mentioned by the User.
22) Find the solution for the series given as (1/1! + 1/2! +1/3! + ….. + 1/N!).
The value of N will be mentioned by the User.
23) Check for any given number is Armstrong or not.
Note an Armstrong number is such a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
24) Write a program to check whether a given number is a prime number or not.
25) Write a program to find the sum of all prime numbers within a given range.
26) Write a program that prompts users to enter numbers. This process repeats until the
user enters -1. Finally, the program prints the count of prime and composite numbers
entered.
<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
26) Write a program to count the number of each vowel in a sentence.

27) Write a program to read a string and check whether the string is a palindrome or not.
    
29) Write a program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of the last
character havebeen changed to ‘*’, except the last character.

30) Write a program to count the occurrences of a word in a given sentence.
31) Write a program to detect whether two strings are anagrams or not.

32) Write a program to find the maximum and minimum of a list of numbers without
using built-in functions.

33) Write a program to find the union of two lists.

34) Write a program to concatenate two lists using list comprehension.
35) Write a program to ask the user to enter a file name with its proper extension and the
system will display the file extension only.
36) Create a list with at least 15 items and remove all duplicate items from that list.
37) Add the item 7000 after 6000 in the following Python List.
Given List: [10, 20, [300, 400, [5000, 6000], 500], 30, 40]
38) Extend a given nested list by adding the sub list ["h", "i", "j"] in such a way that it will
look like the following expected list.
Given_List: ["a", "b", ["c", ["d", "e", ["f", "g"], "k"], "l"], "m", "n"]
Expected_List: ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], 'k'], 'l'], 'm', 'n']
39) Write a program to multiply two matrices as nested lists.

40) Write a program to create a list from two given lists ‘list1’ and ‘list2’ of numbers such
that it containsnumbers that are present in ‘list2’ but not in ‘list1’.

40)Write a program to find the distinct pair of numbers whose product is odd from a list of
integers.
